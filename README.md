# Chemistry-Terminal-Script
Basic Python Script for solving various chemistry equations in the Terminal

## Project is being overhauled
The code is very old, I am re-writing the program to be more efficient an readable

## Goal:
Input: group of variables \n
Output: all variables that can be derived from the input variables recursively

Modular: Easy to add more equations, constants, variables, etc.. 
Easy to Iterate on

## Usage:
Install python3.10+ (You should be able to figure out how to do that) \n
In the terminal: 
```sh
path/to/python3 route/to/Main.py
```
or if you have python installed as an app
```sh
python3 route/to/Main.py
```

### Commands:
```
<exit> or <e> : exits program
<help> or <h> : shows command list
<variables> or <v> : shows variables
```
